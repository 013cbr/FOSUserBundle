How to update your bundle ?
===========================

This document explains how to upgrade from one FOSUSerBundle version to

the "public" API of the bundle. If you "hack" the core, you should probably
follow the timeline closely anyway.

 * The Twig block has been renamed from `content` to `fos_user_content`.
